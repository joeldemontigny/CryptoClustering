# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Elbow Curve Data:

Initial Elbow

## Analysis: Both data source for each applicable Elbow Curve graphs indicate immaterial changes in values.  The Scatter Plots however depict material differences.  Mainly, the PCA clusters have a more dense distribution, therefore improving the accuracy of predictive modeling.
